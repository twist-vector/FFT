This module implements discrete Fourier transforms.

Computes the FFT and inverse FFT of a length N complex sequence.
This is a rather simplistic, bare-bones implementation that uses
recursion rather than looping.  It runs in O(N log N) time but is
_not_ the fastest of algorithms.  Some simple optimizations have
been made, but speed is not the main goal.

Limitations
-----------
  -  requires that N is a power of 2

  -  not the most memory efficient algorithm (returns a new
     vector rather than performing it in place)
